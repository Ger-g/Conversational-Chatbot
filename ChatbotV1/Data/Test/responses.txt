I think your load is as heavy as mine and you are no stronger than I." Teresa said to her: "Dear Brigid, I sprinkled my load with a certain type of grass and therefore I don't feel the load so much." "Oh", cried Brigid, "it must certainly be precious. I would like to lessen my load too. What is it called?" Teresa replied: "The precious grass that lightens all load is called patience.

Sure. A fox, observing a fish cart coming, lay down and pretended to be dead. The cart man, tempted by the idea of making some money by selling the fox's fur, picked up the animal and flung it into the back of the cart. During the journey, the fox ate all the fish and jumped out of the cart. A wolf saw him jumping out and asked him what he had been doing in it. The fox told him all what had happend. Then, the wolf ran ahead of the cart and lay down in its path, pretending to be dead. The cart man was delighted to find another animal to sell, but he found the animal too heavy to lift. So he pushed it into a sack, tied the sack to his cart and dragged it away.
