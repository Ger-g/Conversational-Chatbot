_NAME: The_Velveteen_Rabbit
_CONTENT: A stuffed rabbit sewn from velveteen is given as a Christmas present to a small boy. The boy plays with other presents and forgets the velveteen rabbit.
These presents are modern, and snub the old-fashioned velveteen rabbit. The wisest and oldest toy in the nursery, the Skin Horse, tells the rabbit about toys magically 
becoming real due to love from children. The rabbit is awed by this idea._np_
One night, the boy's nana gives the rabbit to the boy to sleep with, and the rabbit becomes the boy's favorite toy, enjoying picnics with him in the spring; 
and the boy regards the rabbit as real. Time passes, and the rabbit becomes shabbier but happy. He meets some real rabbits in the summer, 
and they learn that he cannot hop as they do and say that he is not real._np_
One day, the boy comes down with scarlatina, and the rabbit sits with him as he recovers. The doctor orders that the boy should be taken to the seaside and that his room 
should be disinfected, with all his books and toys burnt, including the velveteen rabbit. The rabbit is bundled into a sack and left out in the garden overnight. 
The toy rabbit cries, a real tear drops onto the ground, and a marvelous flower appears. A fairy steps out of the flower and comforts the velveteen rabbit, 
introducing herself as the Nursery Magic Fairy. She says that, because he is old and shabby and real, she will take him away with her and turn him into real._np_
The fairy takes the rabbit to the forest, where she meets the other rabbits and gives the velveteen rabbit a kiss. The velveteen rabbit changes into a real rabbit 
and joins the other rabbits in the forest. The next spring, the rabbit returns to look at the boy, and the boy sees a resemblance to his old velveteen rabbit.
